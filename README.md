## Features: 
The main features of 'A Study in Red': 
* Program - user inteaction
 There's a continuos interaction between the program and the user throughout the entire use of the terminal application in a input-output relationship. 
 From the beginning the user will have to choose an username for the game and it will be returned as the role they will have in the game. 
 The user will try to catch the responsible of the crime from the main option menu that is gonna appear after a brief introduction, where they can choose between investigating the crime scene, interviewing the suspects, use the notebook, make an accusation or quit the game.

 * Character depth
 For the text-based game to be successful, it was necessary to create suspects with a motive and an alibi. There are a total of five suspects, each own with their own alibi and motives. It's up to the user to try to catch the killer by examining the evidence and reasoning about the suspects' interviews. 

 *  Notebook
 The notebook is a feature on its own for the fact that the user can add, remove, edit and view the notes they wrote just with a single input of the keyboard. 
 It could be a useful tool to write down the evidence and what the user think the killer is.
